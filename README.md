# Bus-Reservation-System

Project Summary:-

What is Bus Reservation System?
• As the name suggests Bus Reservation System is software that handles the entire booking data of the Bus. It is fully based on the concept of reserving bus tickets for various destinations. Previously the task of handling the tickets at a time was very difficult, so there was a need for software that can handle all Bus Reservation systems.

• Therefore, the Bus Reservation System was designed. After the release of this system, the stress and workload of the employee were absolutely finished. It was also time-wasting for the travellers to book a Ticket previously. But now it hardly takes 10 to 15 minutes to book a ticket wherever the passenger is.
